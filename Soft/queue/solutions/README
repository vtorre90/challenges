The Queue Data Structure
Easy version
Your task is to create a data structure for a queue. Implement a Queue class that supports the following methods:

enqueue(item) - adds an item to the queue
dequeue() - removes an item from the queue (FIFO)
peek() - returns the next item in the queue without removing it
isEmpty() - tests to see whether the queue is empty
size() - returns the number of items in the queue
You can use any programming language of your choice.

When committing your solution, make sure to write a README.md file explaining when it is helpful to use a queue and how it differs from a stack.

Hard version
If you want a more challenging version, you can implement a stack in one of the following programming languages:

C
C++
C#
D
Elixir
Erlang
OCaml
Haskell
F#
Scala
Java
Kotlin
Clojure
Swift
